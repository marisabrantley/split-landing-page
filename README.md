# Split Landing Page Project

This project shows split-screen background images, each with overlays. When hovering the mouse on one side of the split screen, it expands to 75% while the other side reduces to 25%.

The background images are cupcakes from my favorite cupcake bakery, Sprinkles. They show the limited-time cupcakes for early March, 2022.

## Objective
* Use CSS transitions to create the hover effects.
* Use JavaScript and the DOM to initiate the hover effects.
